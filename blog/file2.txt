		<p>The breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the south-west.  The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew.</p>

		<p>Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he accepted with secret chagrin.  To travel at this man's expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him.  Still, he was obliged to eat, and so he ate.</p>

		<p>When the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, "sir"&mdash;this "sir" scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this "gentleman"&mdash;"sir, you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat.  But, though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share&mdash;"</p>

		<p>"Let us not speak of that, sir," replied Mr. Fogg.</p>

		<p>"But, if I insist&mdash;"</p>

		<p>"No, sir," repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply. "This enters into my general expenses."</p>

		<p>Fix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.</p>
