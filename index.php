			<p>I'm one of those rare birds that sits in the middle of the right brain &mdash; left brain spectrum. I like structure and organization, and I like a little bit of creative chaos. I like natural beauty and I like puzzles (especially logic puzzles). I like to read fiction and nonfiction. I like to learn something new every day. I like typography and negative space. And I like Bluegrass, Gregorian chant and Sacred Polyphony.</p>
			<p>Web Design and Development allows me to incorporate almost all of those things that make me feel joy. And, hey, I can listen to some fiddle or some chant while I code, right?</p>
