		<header><h3>Hi! I'm Bekah Sealey.</h3></header>
			<p>I'm one of those rare birds that sits in the middle of the right brain &mdash; left brain spectrum. I like structure and organization, and I like a little bit of creative chaos. I like natural beauty and I like puzzles (especially logic puzzles). I like to read fiction and nonfiction. I like to learn something new every day. I like typography and negative space. And I like Bluegrass, Gregorian chant and Sacred Polyphony.</p>
			<p>Web Design and Development allows me to incorporate almost all of those things that make me feel joy. And, hey, I can listen to some fiddle or some chant while I code, right?</p>
			<p>Do you need a new website? I'd love to help you out. I am also eager to grow as a new developer with a company that views my potential, problem-solving skills, and willingness to take on tasks that stretch my current knowledge and complete them, while applying my innate love of logic and organization to produce consistent, clean and standards oriented work, as assets that will yield significant dividends for our mutual benefit.</p>
